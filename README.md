# TemperatureConverter_ConsoleApp
A very basic temperature converter.

I created this console application when I first started out in this career.

You can tell, it is very basic with no unit tests.  I have created other versions of this application in other repositories.

The later versions will show more progress (and some regression) of how I have learnt to program in C#.
